  <div class="body">
    <p>First and foremost, this <span style="font-weight:500">is not</span> a tutorial to using the Vote Staking graphical user interface (“<span style='font-weight:500'>Vote Staking GUI</span>”) or Ethereum Blockchain technology. At their current state, both require preliminary knowledge in order to operate safely and correctly, and to avoid user induced error and/or the dangers of uninformed use.</p>

  <div class="title">Technological uncertainty</div>

  <div class="body">
    <p>Be aware, due to the early stages of Ethereum Blockchain technology and third party use cases, there is an heightened possibility of software bugs, security breaches, potential exploits by malicious actors and user induced error due to uninformed use.</p>

  <div class="title">Vote Staking GUI Vs. Ethereum Blockchain (distributed ledger)</div>

  <div class="body">
    <p>All actions are performed solely on the Ethereum Blockchain, and can be performed directly without any use of the Vote Staking GUI.</p>
    <p>The Vote Staking GUI is <span style="font-weight:500">only</span> a graphical user interface which can facilitate the <span style="font-weight:500">interaction</span> with the Ethereum Blockchain.</p>
    <p>The Vote Staking GUI does not replace the Ethereum Blockchain nor act as a necessary intermediary for actions performed on it, but only as a possible facilitator for ease of use.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="body">
    <p>Actions performed on the Ethereum Blockchain are executed by smart contracts , without any third party interference.</p>
    <p>Actions performed on the Ethereum Blockchain are <span style="font-weight:500">irreversible</span> and cannot be undone, including in the case of user induced error and/or uninformed use.</p>
