                The future of organizations is DAOs. The dxDAO is a next-generation DAO, designed to facilitate global, open trade.

              <a>
                The first dApp governed by the dxDAO will be the DutchX, an open trading protocol for ERC20 tokens using the Dutch auction mechanism. It determines a fair value for tokens, permits trading in low liquidity environments with no third party risk, and mitigates harmful trading practices like front-running.
                You can find all information and documentation about the DutchX <a

                <p>For a decentralized protocol to reach its full potential, every layer of the stack must be decentralized, including governance. When a protocol is sufficiently decentralized at each layer, it becomes more resilient and ultimately more trustworthy for its users.</p>

                <p>Without a central governing body, protocols and dApps will be able to more easily sustain themselves and adjust when facing adversarial risks. When the direction and parameterization of the protocol is collectively governed, users become more confident that further versions will align with their interests.</p>

                <p>In the future, software—through the collective help of human actors—will own itself, run itself, and strategize for itself. Unlimited value exchange is one of the most critical and vulnerable components of the decentralization stack and where this future begins.</p>

                <p>The dxDAO can decide on any governance questions relating to the dxDAO or the DutchX trading protocol. Some examples include updates of the smart contract logic, whitelisting of tokens, changing the fee structure, incentivizing marketing efforts, asking for an additional security audit, or creating a liquidity provision on the DutchX trading protocol. The DAO may additionally find a need to fund its future <a

By default, proposals submitted to the DAO require an absolute majority of voting power to pass—that is, greater than 50% of the total Reputation in the DAO. However, this can be changed so that only a relative majority is required, meaning more Reputation votes for the proposal than against it within a given time frame. Whether an absolute or relative majority is required depends on the activity in a prediction market, in which proposals may be "<a
